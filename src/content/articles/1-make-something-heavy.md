# Think in Systems, Build in Public

> **“Every system is perfectly designed to get the results it gets.”** — W. Edwards Deming

![Women Holding Things - Maira Kalman, 2022.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facc54571-c711-44a0-a529-a501d8565466_680x878.jpeg)

The internet doesn't need another screenshot of a dashboard.

What it does need is an unfiltered look at _why_ that dashboard was built, how it fits into a larger feedback loop, and the principles that shaped its architecture.

## Creating Systems Like Products

Instead of just sharing wins or screenshots, what if we exposed our decision-making frameworks, our automation blueprints, our constraints, and the struggles that fuel our growth?

Instead of just promising results, what if we provided visibility into how we design our systems to make success replicable?

With this approach, failure becomes less mysterious and ideas become infrastructure.

## Building in Public ≠ Building for Applause

Lately, there's been this huge trend of fast shipping getting fast results, clickbait titles like: <strong>Launched my product in 24 hours 🚀</strong>.

But what if the goal wasn’t virality, but _transparency of structure_?

- Would internal and client-facing documentation of products see an improvement?
- Would feedback loops begin looking more like systems audits?
- Would you audit the decisions along the journey instead of blaming the execution?

## Systems Are the Leverage Layer

Everybody is trying to ship things faster. And in a world where investors are itching to get a return on their investments, it makes sense. But if you're thinking long-term, shipping fast can do more harm than good if you aren't shipping _systematically_.

And when you share those systems publicly, you create leverage:

- Trust, because you're transparent about trade-offs.
- Authority, because people can learn from your blueprints.
- Feedback, because your systems are visible and editable.
